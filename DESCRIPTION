Title: Lightweight Repackaging of 'Themes' for 'ggplot2'
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2023-12-11
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: Themes for 'ggplot2' are a convenient way to style plots. The 'hrbrthemes' package
 contains a particularly nice one, but brings along a significant tail of dependencies. So this
 (currently experimental) package brings along just the 'theme_ipsum_rc' theme using the 'Roboto'
 'Condensed' font.  Should the font not be installed on your system, see the help in package
 'hrbrthemes'.
